# Firefly Zero emulator for android

## Compilation instructions

At present you need to install Rustroid on your phone, clone this repository and
run it directly from there or generate an apk from there.
We will soon also provide automatically generated apks via github actions
and the ability to cross compile from a desktop computer and produce an apk from there.
